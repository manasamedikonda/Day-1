This project is a simple Command-Line Calculator built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly in the terminal. The program continues running in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

The calculator supports four main operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes error handling to prevent division by zero and checks for valid numeric inputs. The user-friendly design ensures that even invalid inputs are handled gracefully with clear messages.

The calculator works by defining separate functions for each operation, such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The main function runs a loop that asks the user to select an operation or type â€˜exitâ€™ to quit. After entering two numbers, the calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result. The process repeats until the user exits the program.

This project helps in understanding how to structure a Python program using functions, loops, and conditional statements. It also demonstrates how to handle user input and manage basic exceptions effectively.

To run the program, open the file in VS Code or any text editor, ensure Python is installed, and execute it through the terminal. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
